# What can this program do?
This program is used to control a Beamer from the
[_DIGITAL PROJECTION_](https://www.digitalprojection.com/emea/)
Model _"E-Vision 6900"_(tested) or _"Mercury Quad series"_(not tested).

This application is needed because in our setup the beamer cannot be reached by
its original remote.
